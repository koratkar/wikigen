# WikiGen

A simple wiki generator with a nice front-end theme.

*Work in progress. No code for a while.*

This generator has three main page types:

* Front page: displays newest, popular, and notable – as well as a list below organizing posts according to their tags or category.
* Shelf pages: Collections of quotes, notes, code, and references to material on a subject.
  * Shelf page may be titled: "Concepts in Information Theory", include many quotes from famous documents, and include *interactive* elements for the user to understand different concepts
* Timeline pages:
  * "Timeline of Information Theory", and cover the lives of Shannon, Turing, von Neumann, and include nice timelines
* Article pages:
  * Article page may be: "Applications of information theory", and be mostly prose
  * Article pages have nice footnotes, which are listed neatly in a side-bar on a wide screen, or compactly in the footer of the page

Element types:

* Interactive element: Code the user can interact with on their own device
* Quote element
* Math element: renders latex
* Timeline element
  * Forecast element
  * Basically a nice 

Stylization:
* Dark mode
* Light mode

For back-ups: 
* Emails you the code for every page on a weekly basis or something?
* Could have like a cronjob or something
